    <h6>Question 2</h6>
    <p><i>web development, the only subject where my interest <b>linger</b> without much effort,</i>i might refer to it as my best subject so far treated. I think the first time i discovered my strong interest in the subject was during my participation in the very first class, my experience during the class was relatively a very interactive one, which was largely fueled by the lecturer who taught the subject that day. Anyways my interest in the subject only grew from that day onward. <em>haha</em> i started blarbing without introducing myself. i am <u>Venantius chinonso</u> some of my friends call me <strong>Hunter</strong>, you might <mark>wonder</mark> what i hunt - <small>well lets leave that discussion for another day</small>ðŸ˜‰. <del>HMML</del> sorry <abbr title ="Hyper text Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, <ins>(a language that enables the production of documents in the internet)</ins> is the section that i find most fascinating in web development, in fact if you have'nt noticed yet i am currently making use of it writing this piece. 4 glasses H<sub>2</sub>O = 2<sup>2</sup> glass = 4 glasses of water - <q>what! does this have to do with this write-up</q>, that you might ask, well just ignore it. conficus once said <blockquote>it does not matter how slow you go so long as you do not stop.</blockquote> lets move on to what we have for today. <code><!DOCTYPE html>
